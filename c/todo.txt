- sqlite3 errors do something weird wrt scroll, need to at least have a way to repaint the screen if it gets weird. looks like I need to redirect STDERR somehow or it prints to the terminal all funny
- implement shutdown script, clean up and close the pipes on program termination
- don't crash if I try to write to a terminal that is closed, just delete the entry in termset
- create a key to go up one level instead of all the way back to the root, maybe make some paths sticky and some not.
- need to send a \n after entering a command
- segfault on the blender>submenu case
